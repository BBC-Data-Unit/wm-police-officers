In August 2016 we [reported on West Midlands Police plans to recruit 1,150 staff, including 800 officers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-37223782).

The piece added historical context to the figures, showing how they had fallen year-on-year since 2009. It also broke down officers by rank, showing that constables had been cut most.
